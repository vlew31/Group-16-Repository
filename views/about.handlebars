            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>About 92 million tons of textiles end up in landfills annually, of which 18.5% is contributed by the United States. In order to reduce waste and give old/unwanted clothes another opportunity, $waggle is a site where users can haggle for swag. In other words, they can sell or purchase resale/thrifted clothing. By recycling clothing, our site helps reduce the ever increasing demand for the manufacturing of new clothing.</p>
